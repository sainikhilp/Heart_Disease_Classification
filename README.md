# Heart_Disease_Classification

This project aims at classifying whether a patient is suffering from heart disease or not based on certain physical features such as age, cholestrol, blood pressure etc.


# Data

Original Source: [(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)]

This database contains 14 physical attributes based on physical testing of a patient. Blood samples are taken and the patient also conducts a brief exercise test. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer (0 for no presence, 1 for presence).

Attribute Information:

* age
* sex
* chest pain type (4 values)
* resting blood pressure
* serum cholestoral in mg/dl
* fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
* resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
* maximum heart rate achieved
* exercise induced angina
* oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
* thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
* target:0 for no presence of heart disease, 1 for presence of heart disease
